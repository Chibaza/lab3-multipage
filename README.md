## Project Description  
This project demonstrates the use of CSS3 to create a responsive multipage website using Flexbox, Grid, media queries, and animations. The site consists of three pages:  

- Home Page (index.html)  
  - Displays a hero banner and an "About Us" section.  
  - Uses Flexbox to align the "About Us" and "Latest News" sections side by side.  
  - Shared navigation bar across all pages.  

- Services Page (services.html)  
  - Uses CSS Grid to arrange service cards.  
  - Each card has a hover effect and unique background styling.  
  - Background image applied to the entire page.  

- Contact Page (contact.html)  
  - Includes a responsive contact form (Name, Email, Message).  
  - Uses HTML5 validation for required fields.  
  - The submit button is centered and bold with an animation.  

## Features Implemented  

- CSS Selectors: Applied ID and class-based styles for structured and reusable CSS.  
- Flexbox & Grid:  
  - Flexbox used for navigation bar and home page sections.  
  - Grid used for the service card layout.  
- Media Queries:  
  - Implemented breakpoints for 1024px, 768px, and 480px to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes.  
- Animations & Transitions:  
  - Hover effects for service cards.  
  - Button animations for better user interaction.
